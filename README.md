Task Challenge

In this repository is located a code in Python 3 that led to the user to create a List of integers and finds all the tuples of elements that sums a specific number that the user also imputs for the comparison.
The code sort the list to find the tuples in an scallable cycle that iterates in O(n/2) of the size of the list.

To test the code elementComparisson.py please compile the file in Python 3 and run it on the console to test it.
